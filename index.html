                                    <p> Transitioning from a suburban neighborhood into a campus located in the hearth of Seattle can appear overwhelming. This is the case for University of Washington as its campus is over 600 acres of land which accompanies its students and facilities. Seattle is commonly known for its rainy weather, however in this article I am looking forward to elaborate more on the infrastructure as well as common trends in 
                                        which students take routes. It’s important to showcase the patterns because it visualizes the frequency in public transportation usage and popular buildings outside of classes.</p>
                                    <p> One of Seattle’s key features which students are offered is the accessibility of public transportation. In our data, there will be areas that cover long distances without the use of a personal vehicle. And this is due to public transportation resources that have been incorporated into the city. Visitseattle.org is a website that hosts the available transportation and schedule. They state that “Seattle is easy to navigate with a  wide variety of smart transportation and options” (visistseattle.org). Options such as link light rail, Metro Transits, Bikes/Scooters are all feasible options in getting around in Seattle. They also hold ORCA cards which allow for easy transactions and offer reduced costs for customers. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p> The data utilized for this lab are sourced from current lab members inputting our common routes. The nodes included are University of Washington buildings, as well other neighborhoods and cities located in Washington. Due to the data being extracted from the group members, this data mainly showcases common trends of those majoring in the Geography Department and does not showcase the general usage of patterns of other students within the campus. </p>

                                    <p>Commuting southward to the University of Washington Campus, I often pass by many neighborhoods. Occupied with other personal matters, the only narrative I am able to perceive while passing these neighborhoods is through the lenses of the link light rail window. One of SoDo’s popular facilities is the T-Mobile park where it hosts their Seattle Mariners, and Lumen Field, where NFL Seattle Seahawks and XFL Seattle Sea Dragons home field is located at. With many sports teams associated with SoDo, I decided to capture the health and fitness within SoDo. </p>
                                    <p>The idea of health and fitness is vague, as it takes forms in several ways. However, its purpose remains the same- acquiring a level of commitment to maintaining a healthy lifestyle. The vagueness of health and fitness allows the exploration of different physical activities. For one, Washington is well known for its endeavors in hiking. An activity that puts stress in the lower body along with endurance. With SoDo being a central point for sports teams, I plan to showcase the lifestyle within health and fitness South of Seattle. These places cover all levels of   fitness- from weight lifting, boxing, and other forms such as pilates.   </p>
                                    <p>The dataset source implemented into this lab is from Yelp API. The data was sourced on 1/28/2027, showcasing the Gyms within SoDo.. The image is cropped as it originally had 150+ rows of information. For each gym location accounted for, there are 6 reviews. However, if the location does not have enough reviews, it only shows the number of reviews it currently has. A few locations are only limited to 2 reviews as they are not popular.</p>

                                    <p>This essay aims to project Seattle in the context of colors. Stereotypes that are commonly known in Seattle are the color of gray, representing the gloomy weather that occupies the city. However, despite the claim, my essay argues that Seattle is associated with other colors, primarily green. The idea behind is that Washington is known to be the Evergreen State- green being an important factor that resides in Seattle.</p>
                                    <p>Why is the context of color important? To better understand this question, Color Psychology: The Effects of Color (Mountain Vista, 2021) illustrates that “ Colors close to the red spectrum are warmer colors, including red, orange, and yellow. These warm colors evoke emotions ranging from feelings of warmth and comfort to feelings of anger and hostility. Whereas blue colors like purple and green are known for evoking feelings of calm, sadness, or indifference”. Depending on the color, it can influence the emotions evoked by the people. Which brings us to the lab with the purpose of calibrating the idea of green in Seattle.</p>
                                    <p>The process of this lab includes taking 30 pictures periodically in a span of a week. The location we chose as a group was on the campus of University of Washington. The area we covered was behind the water fountain showcasing a field of grass. After capturing all 30 images, we move into the Image Processing in colab. We automated the code so that the code captures the 10 most dominant colors and changes the color values in the format of hex instead of RGB. We capture all the data into a dataframe using the pandas library. The final output includes 300 rows of data showcasing the data, color, number of pixels, and percentage. </p>

                                    <p>This essay aims to portray Seattle in levels of happiness corresponding to the location as well as time. The general idea of this project is to share experiences subjective to the person in what areas are considered to be a place that brings happiness to the individual. At the end of this essay will display a visualization showing the activities grouped by the location and time.</p>
                                    <p>An important trait of geography is the concept of space. Space is dynamic and constantly changing. How we perceive a certain area can be interpreted differently by others. Culture, social, personal factors, all of which contribute to how we interact and form a relationship with space. An article posted by Dipesh Karmarkar discusses Space: The Essence of Geography noting that “Space is not just physical, but it is also human! Human space zooms in on the fascinating realm where people and their environment converge. It’s a realm where societies mold and adapt to their surroundings, shaping everything from the layout of cities to the web of transportation networks.”(Karmarkar, 2023). Karmarkar highlights the interpretation and emotional connection to the environment.</p>
                                    <p>The process of this lab involves creating a fictional character in the means of a Balloon. And then after to select a place to take a picture alongside with the balloon that captures happiness. Happiness is subjective, can be captured through an action or a place, it is not limited in this lab. The post is then uploaded into Padlet where the data can be extracted into a CSV format. In order to measure happiness, my approach  to this lab was to measure the happiness level by the amount of verbs found in the description.  I thought this would be a good idea as this project aims to show activities associated with a positive feeling in the form of activities- verbs being a great indicator. After manually adding the verbs counted, I then transported the file into Colab where the CSV was transformed into a JSON file. And then the columns inserted into the plotly express to create the visualization. The figure at the right hand side represents the data sheet that was used to construct the visualization.</p>

                                            <p style="text-align: left;"><b>Abstract</b></p>
                                            <p style="text-align: left;">Seattle is a metro city serving as the hub in the heart of the Pacific Northwest. Often associated with its Evergreen landscapes,  and technological innovation, Seattle embodies the essence of a modern metropolis. Arguably, parallel to its counterpart, Seattle is also known for its Seattle Freeze- characterized by the city’s social life, where it may become challenging to create connections despite the positive encounters. As well as the weather associated with being composed of gray clouds and rain which contributes to its internal gloomy weather. </p>
                                            <p style="text-align: left;">My purpose of presenting this essay is to re-illustrate Seattle to showcase the niches not commonly known outside of Seattle. Many of these projects are based on the University of Washington campus. They are orientated to showcase differing features of Seattle, while simultaneously approaching the visualization through various methods in data collection and oppose the ‘Seattle Freeze’ narrative. </p>
                                            <p style="text-align: left;">Some applications included in these projects are QGIS, Yelp API, Class input, image processing, and QGIS. Mainly using Google Colab to create the visualizations using Python and additional extensions such as observable, padlet, and figma to finalize the visualizations. During the development stage, we incorporated Google Jamboard to brainstorm ideas and create a plan to complete the projects.</p>
                                            <p style="text-align: left;"><b>1.1 - UW COMMUTERS SANKEY DIAGRAM</b></p>
                                            <p style="text-align: left;">Based on my results in all 4 labs, Seattle is a dynamic metro city that has a lot to offer towards its residents and newcomers. Covering the first project, 1.1 - UW COMMUTERS SANKEY DIAGRAM, illustrating the commonly visited areas by students by transportation. It shows that there are many public transportation options offered: Busses, Sounder/Link Light Rail, Ferries, and electric Scooters/Bikes. These are all unique modes of transportation directed towards the navigation of a large city. These findings not only shed light on practical aspects of commuting, but as well as the urban design in the accessibility of transportation and the vitality in the transportation infrastructures.</p>
                                            <p style="text-align: left;"><b>1.2 RADIAL DENDROGRAM: SODO, SEATTLE</b></p>
                                            <p style="text-align: left;">An important factor to incorporate within Seattle is the recreational activities. In this project, I aimed to project the gyms within Sodo and capture their locations as well as their reviews associated using the Yelp API seen in 1.2 - RADIAL DENDROGRAM: SODO, SEATTLE. The dendrogram shows the positively rated gyms, many of comments include the excitement of creating connections with trainers benefiting to their lifestyles. This positive layer adds depth to the city's fabric, showcasing not only the availability of recreational facilities in Sodo but also the thriving community engagement and the positive impact these establishments have on the lives of Seattle residents. The generated map in the dendrogram shows the clusters of gyms relative to one another. Which connects back to the availability in commuting to these areas by the transportation offered by King County. Everything is closely tied to one another, exhibiting the ability to network with other residents</p>

                                            <p style="text-align: left;">One of Seattle’s characteristics is the clouds and rainy weather that often takes place in the city. This leads to the association of Seattle with the color gray/blue due to the climate. However, in Project 1.3 -  IMAGE PROCESSING: COLOR OF SEATTLE argues that the overall color is best represented by green, showcasing the Evergreen State- Washington. This project the colors being most represented taking pictures of the same location within a span of a week with a total of 30 pictures. Based on the results of the image processing, it shows that Seattle is more painted with darker colors of green. The color green holds significance as it portrays Seattle providing a presence of green hues in the connection to nature and identity as the Evergreen State.</p>

                                            <p style="text-align: left;">The last project takes the input of those in Seattle- asking what their favorite places are and invokes happiness. It captures the general idea of Seattle as well as the niches of those who reside in the city. For the most part, many students find themselves in their happy places in various locations that relate actions of eating/drinking, admiring the scenery, or specific activities they personally like. In the model, I decided to categorize the activities by time, hoping to capture the happiness in relation to time. As well as deciding to represent the datum by the amount of verbs represented in the short description. To conclude, it seems that many people in Seattle are happier in the mornings than any other time. Again, a large majority involves eating and enjoying the scenery of Seattle. This comprehensive exploration paints a vivid picture of Seattle's offerings to its residents, showcasing the city's intrinsic connection to its natural environment and the diverse sources of joy it provides.</p>
                                            <p style="text-align: left;"><b>Workflow</b></p>
                                            <p style="text-align: left;">A lesson I’ve learned throughout this entire process is that wrangling with data takes an extensive time. The coding in the creation of the visualization is often less work than the process of developing the data. I also have stemmed away from conventional data collection that are pre-modeled or collected online. These labs allowed me to practice incorporating inputs from the classes and other people, as well as accessing an organization API such as Yelp. Creating visualizations based on a small community highlights the features not usually represented in large media.</p>
                                            <p style="text-align: left;">The pace of collaborating in groups also allowed me to share ideas with many people, showing unique approaches and ideas when developing these projects. The diversity workfield  heightened my shares of insights and invoked new ideas for future plans</p>
                                            <p style="text-align: left;">Ways I could improve would be to continue practicing and invoking information that brings interest to me. This will allow me to gain more experience as well as incorporating new ideas allowing me to display visualizations in the lenses of other perspectives.</p>
                                            <p style="text-align: left;"><b>Takeaways</b></p>
                                            <p style="text-align: left;">This coursework has provided me insights in both creating visualizations and collection of data.  While it did touch on geography lessons, the focus shifted to presenting us with diverse methods for recording information, unique measurement techniques, and varied approaches to representation. I found these methods interesting and opened my scope to the various methods shown in class. This course allowed me to take a step back, away from practical cartography aspects of geography, and introduced me to a more diverse array of methods for data exploration and visualization. It has further piqued my interest and perspective in how information can be communicated effectively.</p>
                                            <p style="text-align: left;"><b>Future Projects</b></p>
                                            <p style="text-align: left;">Moving forward, I would like to reach out to new realms of underrepresented groups to showcase the literature of Seattle, and the uniformed cultures that intertwine with one another. Through this, I hope to introduce communities that are not often noted to the public. Communities I have in mind could be small restaurants, gaming, and/or Seattle Bikers.</p>
                                            <p style="text-align: left;"><b>Conclusion</b></p>
                                            <p style="text-align: left;">Seattle has a lot to offer, ranging from plethora of transportation, recreational activities, Evergreen State highlighting the nature aspect, and activities in correlation to happiness scale. While escaping the stereotype of the "Seattle Freeze" may prove challenging, these visualizations serve as the initial stride in revealing the multifaceted backbone of Seattle. They illuminate the extensive range of activities that contribute to the city's dynamic character, challenging preconceptions and showcasing the depth of experiences that Seattle has to offer.</p>
